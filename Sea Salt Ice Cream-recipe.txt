Ingredients:

- two eggs
- 2 cups of milk
- 1/3 cup of sugar
- 1 teaspoon of vanilla
- 1 cup of heavy whipping cream
- sea salt (not just salt)
- blue and green food coloring

Steps:
1: Separate the eggs. Yolk in one bowl, whites in the other bowl.

2: Beat the egg whites until they are stiff.

3: Put sugar in the bowl with yolk and mix.

4: Pour milk into a pot and cook under medium heat. Stir occasionally.

5: Pour the milk into the yolk and sugar mixture and mix well.

6: Put it back into the pot until thick enough to make custard.

7: Pour it into the mixed egg whites and mix.

8: Now for the important part, add sea salt. Get a good balance between the sweet and salty. Do not add too much or you may get sick from the saltiness.

9: Insert into the fridge to cool.

10: Once the mixture is cooled, add cream and vanilla.

11: Add 12 drops of blue food coloring and 3 drops of green food coloring.

12: Pour into the Popsicle molds and into the freezer or follow the instructions from your ice cream maker. Thank you for making sea salt ice cream. Just don't go on a high tower and eat it kids!
